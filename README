# PicoLibSDK for Linux 

## Description

Effort for better integration under the Linux system (debugged under Debian/Ubuntu distributions) PicoLibSDK - Alternative SDK library for Raspberry Pico, RP2040 and RP2350
A fork of the full version of PicoLibSDK is here in a branch called Original-fork. That is, with compilation scripts for Windows and ready-made binaries for SD cards
or direct upload to Rpi Pico. And of course, you can find the latest version of this SDK with complete documentation from the author of the entire Panda38 project: 
https://github.com/Panda381/PicoLibSDK

## Usage

1) git clone https://github.com/DamianVCechov/PicoLibSDK_for_Linux.git
2) cd PicoLibSDK_for_Linux/_tools
3) ./compile_tools.sh

You can also insert the necessary aliases manually at the end of the file ~/.bashrc or ~/.profilerc.
These aliases will make your translation work easier.

alias c='bash c.sh'
alias d='bash d.sh'
alias e='bash e.sh'
alias ce='bash ce.sh'
